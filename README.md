# ComputerNetworkLab

## Description
This is my personal solution to part of UCAS Network Lab(2018Autumn), hope it provide some suggestions for debugging and implementation issues. It 's a **VERY BAD** idea to just copy that bugged version just to finish your own assignment(some of them even can't run correctly!). It's YOU not any one else deciding your life.

## How to use
Just look the source code inside each assignment
